My experience with pair programming
===================================

I honestly tried to experience pair programming. The biggest problem for me was to find convenient time to work on this, when others are also available. I started 3 sessions at the time convinient to me - noone showed up. This is much more frustrating than working on the code.

I prefer peer review of a completed code compared to someone watching behind my back and essentially wasting his time. I honestly see no benefits to pair programming
