My experience with pair programming
===================================

I sure had fun doing pair programming, especially on the refactoring step. I did learn a lot from my partner using Enumerable to the max, something which I was not even aware of.

The hardest thing was to organize video recording of the pair programming session as I needed to start the Hangout first and then share the right screen. This failed on first 2 attempts and I will try again.

Still, I prefer peer review of a completed code compared to someone watching behind my back and essentially wasting some of his time.
